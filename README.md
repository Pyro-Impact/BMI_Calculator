# BMI_Calculator

Welcome to the BMI Calculator.

The calculator requires your name, so if you aren't comfortable with that, just put whatever for it.

The calculator uses both pounds/inches and kilograms/meters so you'll want to type 1 for pounds/inches 
and anything else (preferrably 2) for the second option, (kilograms/meters).

The calculator will then ask for your weight and height. 

If you chose the second option (kilograms/meters), the calculator will convert those units into pounds/inches 
which will give essentially the same result because the pounds/inches formula is used for all.

The calculator will tell you how healthy you are based on BMI.
