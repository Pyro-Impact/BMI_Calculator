The original code came from this tutorial. I've modified it by the following:
1. Making an Input (the original didn't have an input)
2. Added unit conversion for both metric and imperial
3. Added new weight classifications
4. Added a long if/else statement in the function
5. Added classes and functions
6. Added modules

Welcome to the BMI Calculator.

The calculator requires your name, so if you aren't comfortable with that, just put whatever for it.

The calculator uses both pounds/inches and kilograms/meters so you'll want to type 1 for pounds/inches 
and anything else (preferrably 2) for the second option, (kilograms/meters).

The calculator will then ask for your weight and height. 

If you chose the second option (kilograms/meters), the calculator will convert those units into pounds/inches 
which will give essentially the same result because the pounds/inches formula is used for all.

The calculator will tell you how healthy you are based on BMI.
